            I'm a full stack web developer based in the DC Area üèõÔ∏è. As a design
            oriented engineer, I'm passionate about building clean, playful,
            engaging, and functional applications & websites.

            I've transitioned into tech from education and hospitality fields.
            Why software engineering? Because I love being challenged, working
            in highly collaborative environments, enjoy building meaningful
            things, and wanted to see my impact in real time.

            Born and raised in the DMV, I've got a penchant for off-the-beaten
            path kind of travel, documentary photogaphy, art films, and Trader
            Joes Coffee Bean flavored ice cream.
