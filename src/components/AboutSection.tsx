            Hey there! I'm a full stack software engineer based in the
            Philadelphia Area ðŸ””.

          <p>
            Currently I'm working in education technology at Snap! Mobile, where
            we enable schools to effectively raise funds for their school
            sports/extracurricular activities by providing them with the
            necessary tools to start and manage a campaign. I love knowing what
            I do affects the lives of hundreds of thousands of students
            everyday!
          </p>
          <p>
            I've transitioned into tech from education and hospitality fields.
            Why software engineering? Because I love being challenged, working
            in highly collaborative environments, enjoy building meaningful
            things, and wanted to see my impact in real time.
          </p>

            Born and raised in the Northern Virginia, I've got a penchant for
            off-the-beaten path kind of travel, documentary photogaphy, art
            films, and Trader Joes Coffee Bean flavored ice cream.
